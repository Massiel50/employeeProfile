# employeeProfile
Generates a profile of employees based the information inputed


  This program is created to ask the user in the command line a series of questions based on facts and their preference of color.
It then generates a pdf profile from the data received. 

   The command will ask for their favorite color and Github name. An api request will get information like an image, how many 
 repo's in the git account, stars, occupation and location from the git api. The profile will generate with the picture and nicely 
 place the data in an organized and pretty way.
