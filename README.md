# employeeProfile
Generates a profile of employees based the information inputed and spits onto the page.

Terminal prompt will start by making a manager profile.
Submit the manager's name, id number, email and office number.

After the manager profile is created, you are given a selection of team members to add to your team.
You are given three choices: generate an engineer profile, generate an intern profile or stop adding to your team.

Each employee profile has a name, id number and email. When creating an engineers profile, you will be asked to submit
an additional piece of information; the github username. When creating the student profile you will also be asked to submit
an additional piece of information; the intern's school.

Once you have submitted all the information and generated profiles for your entire team, you would select the last option 
'finish adding'. This option populates a web page with the information provided of each employee. Each employee profile will
be displayed on a card side by side.
